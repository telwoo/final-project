## Presentation

### Selected topic
### Reason why they selected their topic
### Description of their source of data
### Questions they hope to answer with the data
### Description of the data exploration phase of the project
### Description of the analysis phase of the project
### Technologies, languages, tools, and algorithms used throughout the project
Slides Presentations are drafted in Google Slides.

### Github
Main branch should include:
- All code necessary to perform exploratory analysis
- Most code necessary to complete the machine learning portion of the project
README.md README.md must include:
- Description of the communication protocols has been removed
- Cohesive, structured outline of the project (this may include images, but should be easy to follow and digest)
- Link to Google Slides draft presentation
Note: The descriptions and explanations required in all other project deliverables should also be in your README.md as part of your outline, unless otherwise noted. Individual Branches
- At least one branch for each team member
- Each team member has at least four commits for the duration of the third segment
(12 total commits per person)

### Machine Learning
- Description of data preprocessing
- Description of feature engineering and the feature selection, including their decisionmaking process
- Description of how data was split into training and testing sets
- Explanation of model choice, including limitations and benefits
- Explanation of changes in model choice (if changes occurred between the Segment 2 and Segment 3 deliverables)
- Description of how they have trained the model thus far, and any additional training that will take place
- Description of current accuracy score
Additionally, the model obviously addresses the question or problem the team is solving.

### Database
- N/A

### Dashboard
- Images from the initial analysis
- Data (images or report) from the machine learning task
- At least one interactive element
