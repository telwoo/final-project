# Final Project - Diamonds üíé are forever... but is their value? üßê

# Overview

Diamonds have a variety of measurable characteristics that contribute to the overall value of the diamond itself. This study is a supervised learning problem because each diamond and it's features are associated with a target price. As a group of data scientists, we are interested in analyzing the measurements and classifications of a diamond to understand the numerical value in the year 2022.

## Github

Through the course of this project we had to merge 4 seperate GitHub accounts. Chauntel created the repository to host the code for the final project. We aligned on naming the repository final-project. After Chauntel created the repository, she invited Graeme, Suchitra, and Matthew to collaborate. In total we had to have 17 branches and 4 commits per branch (per team member). Through this process we learned to: merge on the master branch, perform quality assurance, test the code, and navigate through merge conflicts as a team. 

### Communication
*To ensure effective communication, we aligned on availabilities early on and created a communication plan.*
