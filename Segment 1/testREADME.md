# Final Project

## Purpose:
The overall purpose of this project is to test our data analytics skills, to be able to analyze and craft databases to our needed objective. 


### Role Definitions: 
- Square: The team member in the square role will be responsible for setting up the repository. This includes naming the repository and adding team members.

- Triangle: The team member in the triangle role is responsible for creating a simple machine learning model. Creating a simple model this early in the design process helps a team better understand where and how a machine learning model will fit into the project. 

- Circle: The team member in the circle role is in charge of the mockup database. This means you're using a SQL-based database, including an ERD of the database and a document pointing out how it is integrated into your database and how it works with the code. You'll need to use either sample data or even fabricated data to test it. 

- X: The team member in the X role will focus on the technology side of the project. Consider these questions: Which tools are the best fit for your project? What will be used for each section? For example, data cleaning and data storage will be completed using two different tools.
