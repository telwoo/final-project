# Final Project - **Diamonds 💎 are forever... but is their value? 🧐**

### Overview 
Diamonds have a variety of measurable characteristics that contribute to the overall value of the diamond itself. This study is a supervised learning problem because each diamond and it's features are associated with a target price. As a group of data scientists, we are interested in analyzing the measurements and classifications of a diamond to understand the numerical value in the year 2022. 

### Source a dataset that will suit your needs (you can even use multiple datasets if applicable).

## Role Definitions: 
- Square: The team member in the square role will be responsible for setting up the repository. This includes naming the repository and adding team members.

- Triangle: The team member in the triangle role is responsible for creating a simple machine learning model. Creating a simple model this early in the design process helps a team better understand where and how a machine learning model will fit into the project. 

- Circle: The team member in the circle role is in charge of the mockup database. This means you're using a SQL-based database, including an ERD of the database and a document pointing out how it is integrated into your database and how it works with the code. You'll need to use either sample data or even fabricated data to test it. 

- X: The team member in the X role will focus on the technology side of the project. Consider these questions: Which tools are the best fit for your project? What will be used for each section? For example, data cleaning and data storage will be completed using two different tools. 


## Segment 1 (Week 1)

### Roles
- Square: Chauntel
- Triangle: Graeme
- Circle: Matt
- **X: Suchitra** ⬅ 🧐
    - **Created and added a repository**
    - **As a team, we aligned on utlizing the following tools: Python, Googlecolab/Jupyter Notebook, and PgAdmin.** 
    - **Initially we will be reading in a CSV > then we will read the CSV into a postgres database > then we will read from the postgres database into what we will be doing > lastly we will be using Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab.** 
    - **Identified two datasets**

**#3 Description of how data was split into training and testing sets**
- We utilized the sklearn.model_selection library to import then split, train and test the data. This allowed 75% of our data to be training data and 25% to be test data.
- Utilized StandardScaler() to scale the features prior to modelling.

**#4 Explanation of Model Choice, including limitations and benefits**
- Linear regression is a classic method to model our dataset, and it is more understandable to our intended audience and less expensive computationally than other modeling methods.

*Created two stories to showcase the visualizations created in Tableau.*

**Cut Breakdown by Dataset:**
- This visual showcases the cut breakdown by dataset. The aggregate result of the dataset showcases that jewlers priced more ideal cut diamonds during the year 2022.

**Quality of Diamond:**
- This visual showcases the quality of a diamond by comparing the cut vs. the average price. We are able to identify the quality by understanding from fairness of the diamond. There are 5 types of cuts and the average price gradually increases as we read from left to right.
