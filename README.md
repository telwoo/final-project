# Final Project - **Diamonds 💎 are forever... but is their value? 🧐**

### Overview 
Diamonds have a variety of measurable characteristics that contribute to the overall value of the diamond itself. This study is a supervised learning problem because each diamond and it's features are associated with a target price. As a group of data scientists, we are interested in analyzing the measurements and classifications of a diamond to understand the numerical value in the year 2022. 

### Source a dataset that will suit your needs (you can even use multiple datasets if applicable).

## Role Definitions: 
- Square: The team member in the square role will be responsible for setting up the repository. This includes naming the repository and adding team members.

- Triangle: The team member in the triangle role is responsible for creating a simple machine learning model. Creating a simple model this early in the design process helps a team better understand where and how a machine learning model will fit into the project. 

- Circle: The team member in the circle role is in charge of the mockup database. This means you're using a SQL-based database, including an ERD of the database and a document pointing out how it is integrated into your database and how it works with the code. You'll need to use either sample data or even fabricated data to test it. 

- X: The team member in the X role will focus on the technology side of the project. Consider these questions: Which tools are the best fit for your project? What will be used for each section? For example, data cleaning and data storage will be completed using two different tools.

- **Created and added a repository**
- **As a team, we aligned on utlizing the following tools: Python, Googlecolab/Jupyter Notebook, and PgAdmin.** 
- **Initially we will be reading in a CSV > then we will read the CSV into a postgres database > then we will read from the postgres database into what we will be doing > lastly we will be using Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab.**
